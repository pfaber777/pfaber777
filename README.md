## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Phillip,
I'm a Junior Front-End Developer with a passion for learning, problem solving and building useful, quality tools and products, however, my curiosity extends beyond only the Front-End.
I have a strong interest in Creative Coding, Technical Art, Graphics & Game Engines as well as Business FinTech.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on strengthening my JavaScript skills alongside learning TypeScript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun and interesting projects that test my current knowledge as well as push my growth in a way that compliments myself and my collaborators equally. 
- ðŸ’¬ Please feel free to reach out for a chat, whether it be just to chat, Network, questions or collaborate.
